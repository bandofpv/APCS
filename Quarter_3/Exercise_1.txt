I created a program Test.java that will print out the result of combining varuous types using the + operator.
Below is the results:

boolean + boolean ==> illegal
boolean + char ==> illegal
boolean + int ==> illegal
boolean + double ==> illegal
boolean + String ==> illegal

char + boolean ==> illegal
char + char ==> legal, addition, int
char + int ==> legal, addition, int
char + double ==> legal, adition, double
char + String ==> legal, concatenation, string

int + boolean ==> illegal
int + char ==> legal, addition, int
int + int ==> legal, addition, int
int + double ==> legal, addition, double
int + String ==> legal, concatenation, string

double + boolean ==> illegal
double + char ==> legal, adition, double
double + int ==> legal, addition, double
double + double ==> legal, addition, double
double + String ==> legal, concatenation, string

String + boolean ==> illegal
String + char ==> legal, concatenation, string
String + int ==> legal, concatenation, string
String + double ==> legal, concatenation, string
String + String ==> legal, concatenation, string

So anything boolean related you can not use the + operator.
When you use + operator for char, you only get ints and doubles due to addition unless you combine it with another String (concatenation).
This is the same characteristic for int and double.
String works with concatenation using the + operator when combining it with everything but boolean.
