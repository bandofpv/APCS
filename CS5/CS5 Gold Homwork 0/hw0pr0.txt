To what extent do artificial languages (such as Python or Picobot) have the ability to shape human thought, if at all?

I think artificial languages do have the ability to shape human thought in the way of you thinking about with curisosity on how might a computer figure this problem out? I've many times thought about how basic and how complex computer programming can get especially with AI. Thats a huge thing now in computer science. How we can change a computer to think like a human. Picobot is a bit too simple to shape human thougth but it does help the brain figure out patterns that could later help you out in math or other probems in life.
